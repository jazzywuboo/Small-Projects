1) First, you need to implement the function print_string_by_character(). (20 points).
2) In the main program, you need to add your code to allocate some memory space from the heap for the
character to construct the letters in the string.
In case of the two-threaded program, you need to assign the specified character with “*” and print the
string “ECE” by calling the function print_string_by_character() in the thread 1 first, and wait 10
seconds to print the initial of your own name by calling the function print_string_by_character().
Meanwhile you need to change the specified character to “#” in the thread 2 after waiting 3 seconds
from the start of this thread, and print the string of “531” by calling the function
print_string_by_character() (35 points).
In case of the two-process program, you need to assign the specified character with “*” and print a
string “ECE” by calling the function print_string_by_character() in the child process first, and wait 10
seconds to print the initial of your own name. Meanwhile you need to change the specified character
2
to “#” in the parent process after waiting 3 seconds from the start of this process, and print the string
“531” by calling the function print_string_by_character() (35 points).
3) Last, you need to compare the results in the two-threaded program and the two-process program, and
draw your conclusions (10 points).
